# Eaglercraft-Revival
(YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD FROM JAN 27TH - MAR 24TH, I DO NOT WANT TO BE INTO ANY TYPE OF LEGAL TROUBLE.) So for some reason, eaglercraft unexpectedly ended, I still have a copy on it on a flash drive that I used for my own purposes.

Anyways, here's the original discription: Eaglercraft is real Minecraft 1.5.2 that you can play in any regular web browser. That includes school chromebooks, it works on all chromebooks. You can join real Minecraft 1.5.2 servers with it through a custom proxy based on Bungeecord.
