# Eaglercraft-1.5.2-Revival
So for some reason, eaglercraft 1.5.2 unexpectedly ended, I still have a copy on it on a flash drive that I used for my own purposes.
Also, mojang or microsoft employee, this does not contain your ip, leave me alone.
Anyways, here's the original discription: Eaglercraft is real Minecraft 1.5.2 that you can play in any regular web browser. That includes school chromebooks, it works on all chromebooks. You can join real Minecraft 1.5.2 servers with it through a custom proxy based on Bungeecord.
The html file will be above the "readme" file.
Until then, cya!
